I made this one night in #php on OPN (now freenode) because 
Philip kept looking up peoples' IRC nicks on a Perl 
script for a lameness score. Many of the people had
especially lame nicks like _-|Sc0rPi0n|-_. I figured
why let Perl do all the work when PHP can, so I made 
the PHP Lame-o-Nickometer. PHP4 required.
