I made this one night in #php on OPN (now freenode) because Philip kept
looking up peoples' IRC nicks on a Perl script for a lameness score.
Many of the people had especially lame nicks like _-|Sc0rPi0n|-_. I
figured why let Perl do all the work when PHP can, so I made the
PHP Lame-o-Nickometer. PHP5 required.
